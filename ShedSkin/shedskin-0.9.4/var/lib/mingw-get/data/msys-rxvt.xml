      <description lang="en" title="rxvt: terminal emulator" >
        <paragraph>VT102 terminal emulator for both X and Windows. This
          version has been modified and compiled for use in the MSYS
          environment, and does not attempt to use an X display even if
          available; it always operates in "native" Windows mode.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>To launch MSYS in an rxvt window, create a shortcut
          to C:\msys\1.0\msys.bat, with the argument "--rxvt". Some
          people find rxvt a more accomodating terminal than cmd.exe, since
          it may be resized at will and has a larger scrollback buffer.
          However, rxvt sometimes does not interoperate well with native
          applications (such as MinGW gcc), so the default cmd.exe console
          is recommended for most users.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>Another alternative console implementation that many users
          find congenial is the "Console 2.00" project.  This replacement
          console is not provided by the MinGW/MSYS team directly for licensing
          reasons (Console 2.00 is GPL, but cannot currently be compiled using
          Libre tools), but you may install the msys-console package which provides
          the `console-config' script.  This script which will download,
          install, and configure the Console 2.00 team's packages.

      <!-- NOTE: the rxvt-2.7.10.20050409-* versions have a serious flaw, in
           that whenever a native application is launched from within an rxvt
           session, a black cmd window pops up. If we ever solve this problem,
           then add newer versions to this manifest. Until then, however... -->
