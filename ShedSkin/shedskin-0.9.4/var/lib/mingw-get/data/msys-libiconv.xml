        <paragraph>This is not the libiconv you are looking for.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>GNU libiconv provides an implementation of the iconv()
          function which is used to convert between various character
          representations for different locales.  This function is provided
          for use on systems which don't already have iconv(), or whose
          implementation cannot convert from/to Unicode. This package also
          provides a tool, iconv(1), which can be used to convert character
          sets from the command line. The associated libcharset provides a
          mechanism to determine the canonical character set name of the
          current locale.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This msys port of libiconv has been modified
          specifically for the MSYS System Builder environment; that is,
          it is intended to be used only when producing binary packages
          for the MSYS subsystem.  If you intend to produce executables
          for the native "mingw32" subsystem which require character
          set conversion (that is, applications that should work on
          Microsoft Windows installations without the MSYS dll), then you
          should install the mingw32-libiconv-* package(s) instead.
