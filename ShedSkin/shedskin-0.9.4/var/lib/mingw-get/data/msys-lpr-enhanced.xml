      <description lang="en" title="lpr-enhanced: A full-featured implementation of unix lpr for MSYS" >
        <paragraph>lpr-enhanced is an implementation of the unix lpr system
          for MSYS, and unlike lpr-basic (msys-cygutils) supports many of
          the advanced capabilities of a true Unix implementation.  These
          features include format-dependent filters to pre-process data
          before spooling to the printer.  The filters may includes nroff,
          ditroff, or TeX pre-processors, among others.  It supports
          /etc/printcap-style configuration, and honors both BSD options
          (when invoked as 'lpr') and SysV options (when invoked as 'lp').
          A sample /etc/printcap file is in /var/spool/lp/config/example,
          but it MUST be copied to /var/spool/lp/config/.active or to
          /etc/printcap and customized for your environment -- just like
          on unix.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The lpr-basic executable from the msys-cygutils package
          (see below) is installed, by default, as both /bin/lpr.exe and
          /bin/lpr-basic.exe.  To use lpr-enhanced, you should manually
          remove /bin/lpr.exe, and manually copy /bin/lpr-enhanced to
          /bin/lpr (and/or /bin/lp).  You may need to repeat this step each
          time msys-cygutils is (re)installed or updated.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>A note about lpr-basic: lpr-basic spools a file to the
          specified printer device.  MSYS provides two separate
          implementations: lpr-basic.exe and lpr-enhanced.  lpr-basic.exe is
          suitable for most simple printing needs; it can send "raw" data
          to any installed Windows printer.  This is most useful for raw
          text, for sending plain PostScript files to PostScript-compatible
          printers, and for re-sending .prn files generated using Windows'
          own print-to-file capabilities to the specific printer for which
          the .prn file was generated.  lpr-enhanced is more capable, more
          unix-like, and more difficult to configure.  Use lpr-enhanced if
          you need the additional flexibility it provides, or are more
          comfortable with traditional unix lpr and/or lp semantics.
