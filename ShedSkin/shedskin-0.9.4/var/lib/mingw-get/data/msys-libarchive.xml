      <description lang="en" title="libarchive (msys): library for handling various archive formats" >
        <paragraph>libarchive is a programming library that can create and
          read several different streaming archive formats, including most
          popular tar variants and several cpio formats, mtree, and ar
          archives.  It can also read shar, zip, jar, and xar archives, as
          well as ISO9660 CDROM images.  It automatically handles gzip,
          bzip2, compress, xz, and lzma compression and decompression, as
          well as uudecode decompression.  The bsdtar program is an
          implementation of tar(1) that is built on top of libarchive.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This MSYS port of libarchive differs from the MinGW
          version also provided by the MinGW/MSYS project.  In addition
          to requiring the MSYS runtime library, this implementation
          supports mtree data and understands MSYS's "unix" style pathnames.
          It also supports archives that contain symbolic links by
          converting them to equivalent hardlink (or recursive copy)
          representations (see msys-bsdtar for more information).  The MinGW
          implementation does not support archives with symbolic links, nor
          mtree data.  It does, however, operate properly on systems where
          MSYS is not installed.  Both msys-libarchive and mingw32-libarchive
          (and their associated bsdtar and bsdcpio subpackages) depend on
          additional DLLs such as msys-liblzma (mingw32-liblzma), etc.
          There is, in addition, a MinGW package that provides a standalone
          version of bsdtar which has no external dependencies and only
          limited functionality: mingw32-basic-bsdtar (see its documentation
          for more information).
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The msys-libarchive package provides the runtime
          library, development files, and documentation for libarchive.
          The associated msys-bsdtar package provides an implementation
          of tar(1) based on libarchive, while the associated msys-bsdcpio
          package provides a similar implementation of cpio(1).

      <description lang="en" title="bsdtar (msys): BSD version of the tar utility" >
        <paragraph>The msys-bsdtar package provides an implementation
          of tar(1) based on libarchive, which manipulates streaming archive
          files -- including the eponymous tar format.  However, bsdtar
          can also extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, mtree,
          and ISO 9660 cdrom images, as well as create tar, pax, cpio, ar,
          mtree, and shar archives.  It supports automatic detection and
          handling of .gz, .bz2, .lzma, .xz, and .Z decompression (and
          compression).  It supports ustar, pax, and GNU tar formats.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This MSYS port of bsdtar differs from the MinGW version
          also provided by the MinGW/MSYS project.  In addition to requiring
          the MSYS runtime library, this implementation supports mtree data
          and understands MSYS's "unix" style pathnames.  It also supports
          archives that contain symbolic links by converting them to
          equivalent hardlink (or recursive copy) representations (see
          below).  The MinGW implementation does not support archives with
          symbolic links, nor mtree data.  It does, however, operate properly
          on systems where MSYS is not installed.  Both msys-bsdtar and
          mingw32-bsdtar depend on additional DLLs such as msys-libarchive

          dependencies and only limited functionality: mingw32-basic-bsdtar
          (see its documentation for more information).
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This msys implementation has some unique behaviors with
          regards to symbolic and hard links.  When creating archives on an
          MSYS platform, there are no symbolic links; hardlinks are archived
          as on unix, without requiring duplicate storage (unless the
          --hard-dereference option is used).  When extracing archives on
          an MSYS platform, if the archive contains hardlinks then they are
          reproduced on the local file system provided the Win32 filesystem
          supports hardlinks (e.g. NTFS; on FAT, a duplicate copy of the
          file is created).  If the archive contains symbolic links where
          the target is a file contained within the archive itself, then
          those links are reproduced as if they were hardlinks, as described
          above.  "Dangling" symbolic links are not supported.  Symbolic
          links to directories within the archive are "supported", by
          creating a recursive copy of the target directory, where the
          contents of the directory are treated as hardlinks as described
          above.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This msys implementation ignores ownership data and
          permission bits; all extracted files are created as if owned
          by the current user, regardless of the current user's root
          (Administrator) status.  All archived files are added to the
          archive with "default" permission and as if owned by the current
          user.

          archives and directories.  This implementation can extract from

          images, as well as create tar, pax, cpio, ar, and shar archives.
          It supports automatic detection and handling of .gz, .bz2, .lzma,
          .xz, and .Z decompression (and compression).  It supports the old
          POSIX.1 portable cpio format (odc), the new SVR4 portable cpio
          format (newc), as well as the POSIX.1 pax and ustar formats.
