        <paragraph>This is not the gettext you are looking for.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>GNU gettext provides a set of tools that create a
          framework to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual
          messages. In this way, with suitable care a single binary
          application can automatically provide user messages (such as
          `help' text) in the language corresponding to the current
          locale settings.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>This msys port of gettext has been modified
          specifically for the MSYS System Builder environment; that is,
          it is intended to be used only when producing binary packages
          for the MSYS subsystem.  If you intend to produce executables
          for the native "mingw32" subsystem (that is, applications that
          should work on Microsoft Windows installations without the MSYS
          dll), then you should install the mingw32-gettext-* package(s)
          instead.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>The msys-gettext package provides utilities that may
          be useful to end-users, allowing interaction with the message
          translation database of other i18n-enabled GNU utilities. It
          also provides the development libraries, header files, and
          documentation for the gettext system, as well as additional
          utilities useful for maintainers of i18n-enabled applications.
          The *-ext package provides extra documentation, in the form of
          example implementations in many different computer languages.
          The associated msys-libgettextpo package provides the runtime
          libraries needed by the msys-gettext utilities; the associated
          msys-libasprintf package provides the runtime library for the
          asprintf utility library; and finally, the associated msys-libintl
          package provides the runtime component of the internationalization
          library itself, which is used by many other msys packages.
